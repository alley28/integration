# FastStart 2020 Boilerplate use cases
===============

### How to use these

As part of your pre-work you were asked to come prepared with your own use cases from your respective industry group/region for the capstone lab project.  In the case where you may not have a usable scenario, we have provided a few here for you.


## Use case 1

ABC Phone Company has retail outlets where they sell telecom based products to their customer base and in order to keep up with competitive pressure, want to leverage real-time events to streamline the sales-cycle and provide an overall better customer experience. ABC has existing data on customers’ usage and buying preferences and they want to be able to Identify customers entering the store using in-store Wi-fi.  The primary goal is to leverage connection events, and combine with existing customer insights to help accelerate and improve the over sales experience. Ideally the solution would operate using real time events to Notify sales assistants and pre-authorize personalized discounts based on previous sales history. In order to accomplish this, ABC is going to need to adopt a modern integration strategy that leverages events & messaging as well as real time integration into their back end inventory/financial systems as well as their cloud based CRM.  Of equal importance are also concerns about security and privacy using customer data, as any solution provided needs to address concerns around GDPR.  Based upon what has been provided above, what would be a recommended approach to help the customer achieve their goal?

## Use Case 2

XYZ Enterprise is a leading supplier of residential and commercial construction and industrial supplies and equipment with more than 500 wholesale locations across North America and has been in business since 1985. Over the years, the company has developed several in-grown applications on different technologies ranging from COBOL to .NET to Java to run their core IT business. Their inventory, order processing, and quality control divisions have been primarily operating over traditional TCP/IP based protocols for the most part although some of the newly developed SOAP and REST based services have been HTTP based. However, with the high volume of transactions that run through their business on a daily basis they have been exploring different vendor technologies to guarantee a more reliable exchange of data with a flexible and security-rich messaging solution. They also partnered recently with a subsidiary cloud-based company that is managing their CRM data on Salesforce and is also influencing them to adopt their microservices based billing system which resides on AWS. They have exposed some APIs for their shipping data but until now haven’t come up with a strategy on how to manage those APIs and make them more consumable with their freight system. With an aging workforce XYZ Enterprise is hoping to decentralize their core IT and move to a more agile architecture with fewer dependencies along their product line in order to scale and remain competitive. They are very interested to understand how IBM can help them get where they need without having to reinvent the wheel and the long term benefits for rearchitecting their solution in that manner.

## Use Case 3

Cash Inc. is a bank facing growing competition, who wants to 
modernize its customer experience to improve customer retention

The cost and time it takes to switch account providers is so low now that customers 
will simply move if they aren’t getting the best possible service Cash Inc has a new initiative to offer a service where customers can be 
alerted in real time when “noteworthy” financial events occur

They do not want to disrupt or add load to their core systems which handle millions of transactions a day & are costly/complex to change

Primary Goals:
Issue alerts in real time, so customers receive relevant information immediately and not when batchprocessing is complete 
Make it possible to add new features E.g. more complex financial events and new types of alerts, quickly and easily over time

What would you recommend to the customer in order to help meet these goals?

## Use Case 4

A European mobile device manufacturer located in Austria has assured its board of directors that it will modernize its platforms and adopt a committed digital transformation in its retail channels.  The recent passage of GDPR has caused the companies technology leadership to take a defensive posture against public cloud favoring private cloud in several recent initiatives.  The CIO is committed to remaining open minded about public cloud and is concerned about the capacity of his current data centers.  He is reluctant to commit to long term growth for these facilities.  Although the data center discussion has not been resolved, they are committed to modernizing their application and integration landscape.

Their banking platform provides API access to internal and external partners.  They have already committed heavily to modernizing these services and have become skilled at microservice architecture and development.  They are now prepared to begin addressing their aging integration layer.  The pain points they have identified during early discussions are as follows:
- Their application teams spend a lot of time waiting for integration changes for activities such as interfacing with their traditional SORs
- None of the integrations team have plans or understanding of how modernize even though they do understand it is necessary
- The leadership from within the integration teams is nervous about upsetting their security posture as they modernize.
